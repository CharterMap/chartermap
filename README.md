## Chartermap

A map of all charters attributed to the Anglo-Saxon period

In-progress design to work as a plugin for any Wordpress site, and ideally CMS-agnostic.

### Multilayer Inline Editor for XML

CharterMap uses a custom implementation of WYSIWYG text editor [tinymce](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce?tab=readme-ov-file) to provide an interface to mark up transcribed manuscript data
